Success is counted sweetest   
 By those who ne'er succeed.   
 To comprehend a nectar   
 Requires sorest need.   
Not one of all the purple host   
 Who took the flag to-day   
 Can tell the definition,   
 So clear, of victory!   

As he, defeated, dying,  
 On whose forbidden ear  
 The distant strains of triumph  
 Burst agonized and clear!
